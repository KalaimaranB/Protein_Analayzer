## Summary
The Bioinformatics Project is an in progress software tool designed to streamline various bioinformatics tasks such as protein analysis, genome management, and data visualization. It includes tools for managing genome data and integrating with various bioinformatics databases. While the project is still in progress and does not yet feature a user interface, it provides a strong foundation for automated bioinformatics analysis and data management through its robust backend functionality. The purpose of this project was to challenge me to better understand how to use generative ai tools to write programs. I wanted to see to what extent generative tools can write quality code and this project allowed me to better understand that. They tend to generally have a decent capability to write functional code, when working locally. However, the use of various APIs and the requirement to connect various outputs together was something that generative ai struggled with and had to be written manually to a larger extent. This project serves to showcase my ability to use ai to write quality functioning code relatively quickly.
